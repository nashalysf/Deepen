## Learning Curve
* While creating this app I learned and practice:
1. Integrated the Apollo Server GraphQL library to handle data requests to our API and built both query type definitions and resolvers for retrieving data and handle updates from a MongoDB database.
2. Signed and verified JWTs as part of the authentication process.
3. Implemented the tools to manage the full-stack MERN application for both production and development environments.
4. Organized and laid out the client-side React application files and used the Apollo Client library to consume the GraphQL API.
5. Used `Routes` and `Route` components to set up client-side routing and used URL parameters in React Router for dynamic page content.
6. Added variables to a useQuery Hook to run queries with arguments. 
7. Set up front-end functionality to create and log in a user using mutations with front-end authentication service to help manage a user’s logged-in status and user’s data on pages.
